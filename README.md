Welcome to the Azores Group GitHub repository, the open-source home for our innovative blockchain-enhanced travel booking system. Here, we're developing a platform that integrates Stellar's blockchain technology to revolutionize how tourists book and pay for experiences in the Azores. 

This repository will contain:

Core Backend Services: Built with Node.js and Express, managing bookings, payments, and user interactions.
Soroban Smart Contracts: Written in Rust, these contracts facilitate the conversion of payments to XLM and manage our loyalty reward system.
Frontend Application: Developed using React.js with TypeScript for a seamless, intuitive user experience.
Documentation: Detailed guides on how to set up, run, and contribute to the project, including API documentation and developer notes.
Testing Suites: Unit and integration tests using Jest and Cypress to ensure reliability and security of the system.

Our goal is to:

Streamline and secure payments using Stellar Lumens (XLM).
Introduce a hybrid payment model where traditional methods are converted to crypto.
Enhance user engagement through a transparent, blockchain-managed loyalty program.
Support local businesses and conservation by leveraging blockchain's efficiencies.

Contributors are welcome to fork, clone, and submit pull requests to help us build a more robust, user-friendly, and impactful travel booking ecosystem. Whether you're interested in blockchain technology, tourism, or just want to contribute to a project that supports sustainable tourism, we invite you to join us.
